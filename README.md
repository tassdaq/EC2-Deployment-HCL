## Project Title
## Create EC2 Instance Including Security Group and Key Pair

# Project Description:
This project involves the automated provisioning of an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance using AWS best practices. The main objectives are to create a secure and configurable virtual server environment that includes:
EC2 Instance: Launch an EC2 instance with the desired AMI, instance type, and configuration settings.
Security Group: Define and attach a security group to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring the instance is protected from unauthorized access.
Key Pair: Generate or use an existing key pair for secure SSH access to the instance.
The project may be implemented using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or infrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation, depending on the use case.

# Deliverables:
EC2 instance with specified AMI and instance type
Associated security group with defined ingress and egress rules
Secure SSH access using key pair
Documentation of steps or deployment script

# Use Cases:
Hosting web applications
Running backend services
Setting up development or testing environments

# Goals:
Ensure secure access to the EC2 instance
Automate repeatable deployment
